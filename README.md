# Application Framework Documentation Hub

## Introduction

This is the documentation hub for the [Application Framework][]. 
It contains the documentation for all components of the framework, 
including a PHP-based web UI that can be used to browse the documentation. 

It is based on Markdown-styled documents which can be accessed
either via Github by browsing into the [documents](documents) folder, 
or via the bundled web UI.

## Web UI installation 

- Clone the repository into a web-accessible folder.
- Run `composer install` to install the dependencies.
- Open the documentation via `htdocs`.
